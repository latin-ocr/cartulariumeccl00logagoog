reproduction. The page which has been reproduced in lacsimile
is not only a good specimen ol the whole, but is perhaps the
most important document conceming the church in the collection,
and is further interesting as exhibiting the autograph signatures
os no iewer than five successive bishops os Aberdeen—William
Eiphinstone‚ the founder of King’s College (1484-1514),
Alexander Gordon (ob. 1518) Gavin Dunbar (ob. 1532), William
Stewart (ob. 1545), and William Gordon (ob. 1577).

The second volume will contain an abridged translation os
the text, with notes and sull indices. lt will also contain in full
the “ Notes on the Church oi Saint Nicholas,'’ written in 1818
by the late Mr. James Logan, now in the possession ol the
Society os Advocates os Aberdeen. A number ol that author's
very beautiful sketches ol the old wood-work, many of them
coloured, will be reproduced, together with other illustrations of
such objects ol interest belonging to the ancient edifice as have
come down to us. The whole will be introduced by a Presace,
giving an architectura] and historical account of the church and

· some notice ol its ministers.
